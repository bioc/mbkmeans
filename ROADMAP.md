# Roadmap

The purpose of this project is to implement clustering algorithms for large single-cell data, with the specific application of HCA data, but these methods will be applicable to any large single-cell data. This "Roadmap" is a rough outline of how we can complete this project.  

## Milestone 1: Implement k-means
*Tracking in issue(s) [#1](https://github.com/drisso/beachball/issues/1).* 

- [ ] create skeleton k-means method to cluster using on data stored in dimensionality reduction slots (virtual class and matrix class) in SingleCellExperiment object [(**#1**)](https://github.com/drisso/beachball/issues/1)

## Milestone 2: Implement k-NN
*Tracking in issue(s) (not yet assigned).*

- [ ] create method for virtual class and matrix class

## Milestone 3: Unit tests

- [ ] Set up TravisCI
- [ ] Create object for unit tests
