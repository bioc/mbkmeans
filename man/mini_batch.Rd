\usage{
mini_batch(data, clusters, batch_size, max_iters, num_init = 1L,
  init_fraction = 1, initializer = "kmeans++", early_stop_iter = 10L,
  verbose = FALSE, CENTROIDS = NULL, tol = 1e-04, seed = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix, DelayedMatrix, or HDF5Matrix containing numeric or
integer data (obseravtions in rows, variables in columns)}

\item{clusters}{the number of clusters}

\item{batch_size}{the size of the mini batches}

\item{max_iters}{the maximum number of clustering iterations}

\item{num_init}{number of times the algorithm will be run with different
centroid seeds}

\item{init_fraction}{percentage of data to use for the initialization
centroids (applies if initializer is \emph{kmeans++} ). Should be a float
number between 0.0 and 1.0.}

\item{initializer}{the method of initialization. One of \emph{kmeans++} and
\emph{random}. See details for more information}

\item{early_stop_iter}{continue that many iterations after calculation of the
best within-cluster-sum-of-squared-error}

\item{verbose}{either TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether progress is printed
during clustering}

\item{CENTROIDS}{a matrix of initial cluster centroids. The rows of the
CENTROIDS matrix should be equal to the number of clusters and the columns
should be equal to the columns of the data}

\item{tol}{a float number. If, in case of an iteration (iteration > 1 and
iteration < max_iters) 'tol' is greater than the squared norm of the
centroids, then kmeans has converged}

\item{seed}{integer value for random number generator (RNG)}
}
\value{
a list with the following attributes: centroids, WCSS_per_cluster,
 best_initialization, iters_per_initialization
}
\description{
Mini-batch-k-means for in-memory, delayed, and on-disk matrices
}
\details{
This function performs k-means clustering using the mini-batch
algorithm of Sculley (2010).

This implementation relies very heavily on the
\code{\link[ClusterR]{MiniBatchKmeans}} implementation. We provide the
ability to work with DelayedMatrix and HDF5Matrix through the \code{beachmat}
library.

\strong{kmeans++}: uses the algorithm of Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2007) to
initialize the centroids.

\strong{random}: random selection of data rows as initial centroids.
