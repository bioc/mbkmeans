# vanilla _k_-means

## Methods 

1. **vanilla _k_-means**: pick _k_, random sample of _k_ "centers", and minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster
	- **Good:** simple, fast
	- *Bad:** No accuracy guarantees
2. **_k_-means++** [reference](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/778/1/2006-13.pdf): _k_-means with randomized seeding for initially picking centers
	- **Good:** faster, more accurate than _k_-means
	- **Bad:**
