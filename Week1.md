- request cluster access; read documentation on using cluster; create small shell script that runs R script.
- clone beachball git repository, create benchmark folder for this work.

- look at introductions/tutorial on HDF5 format
- introduction on S4 (maybe Hadley's Advanced R)
- R vignettes: rhdf5, HDF5Array/DelayedArray,  SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment 
- generate hdf5 file with random data
- save/write to disk for hdf5; read from disk
- compute colMeans, etc. with hdf5 functions
- create SummarizedExperiment/SingleCellExperiment with hdf5 object
- run kmeans and kmeans.plus on hdf5 using as.matrix
	- start thinking about creating code for benchmarking these two

- keep track of useful tutorials (in a .md file)
